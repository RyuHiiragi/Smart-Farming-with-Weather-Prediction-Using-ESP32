# Smart-Farming-with-Weather-Prediction-Using-ESP32
This guide will walk you through building a smart farming system using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system automates irrigation by monitoring soil moisture and integrating weather data to predict water requirements. This project is ideal for optimizing water usage, improving crop yield, and reducing manual labor in agriculture.
